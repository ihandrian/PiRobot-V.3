### 2. Fullscreen Video Feed with Overlay Controls

- Redesigned the interface with a fullscreen video feed
- Added a semi-transparent control panel in the bottom left corner
- Replaced text buttons with arrow icons for more intuitive control
- The control panel has 80% opacity
- Added touch support for mobile devices


### 3. System Information Panel

- Moved system information to the top of the screen
- Made it semi-transparent with white text
- Displays CPU usage, memory usage, temperature, and detection status
- Updates in real-time


### Additional Improvements

- Added visual indicators for person detection (green bounding boxes)
- Added visual indicator for the person being followed (red bounding box)
- Improved error handling for when TensorFlow Lite or YoloV3 is not available
- Added controls to adjust the following speed
- Made the interface fully responsive for different screen sizes


## How to Use
1. Clone this repository. Save all the files to your project directory.
2. Go to your dir "PiRobot-V.1" in your computer.
3. Run virtual environment of your preference, in this case IÂ´m using `venv` to create environment:
    ```plaintext
    python -m venv PiRobot
